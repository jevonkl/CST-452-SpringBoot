# SpringBoot
CST-452 Spring Boot Application
This contains the Senior Prject from GCU which i based on SpringBoot projects from a previous course. 
Within the projects content contains all fo my work from CST-451 & 452
This includes all documentation and reports made between both classes.
The purpose of this project was to create an online resume by creating a website instead. It would show my accomplishments throughout the college career as well as other things of interest that someone may deem valuable.
